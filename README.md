# NetworkAnalyzerüåê

## Overview

NetworkAnalyzer is a Python tool designed to simplify network diagnostics and connectivity testing. It allows you to assess the health and performance of network connections, check host reachability, and monitor real-time and historical ping data. Whether you're a network administrator, a developer troubleshooting network issues, or simply curious about your network's performance, NetworkAnalyzer can help you gain valuable insights.

## Features

### 1. Connectivity Testing

- **Single Host Test**: Check the connectivity and latency to a single host.
- **Continuous Multi-Host Tests**: Monitor multiple hosts with customizable parameters like ping count, interval, and alert thresholds.

### 2. Real-Time Monitoring

- **Real-Time Ping Results**: Observe and plot real-time ping data for a specific host.

### 3. Historical Data

- **Historical Ping Data**: Visualize historical ping data over time for performance analysis.

### 4. Performance Metrics

- **Performance Analysis**: Calculate and display minimum, maximum, and average latency metrics for a host.

### 5. Data Management

- **Data Export**: Save ping data to a file for future reference.
- **Data Import**: Load previously saved ping data for analysis.

## Getting Started

1. Run the script using `python NetworkAnalyzer.py` in your terminal.

2. Follow the menu prompts to choose from various network analysis options.

3. Perform single host tests, continuous multi-host tests, real-time monitoring, historical data analysis, and more.

4. Save and load ping data for comprehensive network assessments.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (install via `pip`):
  - `ping3`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `pyfiglet`

## Usage

- Run connectivity tests for troubleshooting network issues.
- Monitor real-time ping data to detect anomalies.
- Analyze historical ping data for long-term network performance trends.
- Export and import ping data for record-keeping and comparison.
